# CompAero
A python repository for compressible aerodynamics

The goal with this project is to make it easy to determine flow states. This is done by taking compressible aerodynamic tables and computing them. Also more functionality than what is included in the tables is included here as well. This is expected to be a python version of the compressible aerodynamic tables by virginia tech http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html
